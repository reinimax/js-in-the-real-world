These are four little exercises I did in the course of the "JS in the Real World" module at The Odin Project. They don't qualify as real "projects", but I decided nevertheless to put them up here, also because some of the code could be reused in other projects. Since the whole module is about JavaScript, styling is mostly reduced to a bare minimum.


The first task was to make a dropdown menu. I implemented a solution on click and a solution on hover. Both work with applying a class "visible" on an element with the class "dropdown-menu". I learned also more about positioning during this exercise. The dropdown needs to be absolutely positioned inside a positioned container. In this case, as long as offsets are not specified, the absolutely positioned element will respect previous siblings (that is, the toggler, that will expand it), but not following siblings. The hover-solution is actually triggered by the container and not the "toggler-element". This is necessary to prevent the dropdown-menu from collapsing when the mouse moves onto it (and thus leaves the "toggler-element").

The second task was to make a mobile menu. My solution works very similar to the dropdowns, via applying classes to collapse the main content and move the sidebar in (which has also a transition). This time though not the display property is manipulated but the offset of the menu. This exercise was quite fun and gave me a little taste of responsive design.

The slideshow was a bit more difficult, mostly because the CSS needs to be right for it to work: Basically it is a very long div with pictures that moves behind another div that acts as the "picture-frame". This means that the frame needs overflow:hidden and the slider has to arrange all the images in a row (or column) without wrap. Then a counter that is increased or decreased when clicking a navigation element is used to manipulate the offset of the slider. Once I had this part figured out, the rest was easy. I'm quite pleased with the result.

Tha last task was to write form validation in JavaScript. The exercise was more complex than anticipated, but it's challenge level was still quite below that of the more recent "real" projects I did. It was a good opportunity to read up on RexExp.
